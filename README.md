## üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Overview

VeloChain is a cycle-to-earn platform that incentivizes sustainable mobility by rewarding users with blockchain-based tokens for cycling and other eco-friendly activities. By integrating with the Strava API, VeloChain securely records verified activities such as cycling, trekking, and walking, then syncs them with the VeChainThor blockchain to issue rewards.

Each user connects their VeWorld wallet to link their identity and claim accumulated rewards. Activities are processed off-chain for verification (distance, type, timestamps) and then signed to prevent double-claims. Users can later claim their balance directly on-chain, ensuring transparency and fairness.

VeloChain creates a bridge between healthy living, environmental impact, and blockchain innovation, promoting sustainability while showcasing how Web3 can drive real-world behavior change.

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Activity Verification

VeloChain uses **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** to verify the authenticity and quality of cycling activities before issuing rewards. This prevents fraud and ensures only genuine human efforts are rewarded.

### How It Works

1. **Activity Analysis**: When activities are synced from Strava, they're sent to Gemini AI for analysis
2. **Fraud Detection**: AI checks for unrealistic patterns like:
   - Impossible speeds or distances
   - Bot-like behavior patterns
   - Suspiciously short or long durations
   - Inconsistent GPS data
3. **Scoring System**: Each activity receives a score from **0-100** based on:
   - **Human Effort**: Realistic physical exertion
   - **Environmental Benefit**: Contribution to sustainable mobility
   - **Data Authenticity**: Consistency with real cycling patterns
4. **Reward Calculation**: Final token rewards are weighted by the AI verification score

### Implementation

```typescript
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

export async function analyzeActivity(activities: any[]): Promise<any> {
  const ai = new GoogleGenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY!,
  });
  
  const completion = ai.chats.create({
    model: "gemini-2.0-flash",
    history: [{
      role: "user",
      parts: [{
        text: `You are an AI verifier for VeloChain, a blockchain-powered "cycle-to-earn" platform.
        
        You will receive multiple Strava activity records in JSON format. 
        For each record, return a score from 0‚Äì100 representing human effort and environmental benefit.
        
        Rules:
        - If activity data looks unrealistic (e.g. too high/low speed, too short, or bot-like), return score: 0.
        - Do not skip or reorder activities ‚Äî return one result per input.
        - Only include id and score in the response.
        - Return valid JSON only.`
      }]
    }]
  });

  const response = await completion.sendMessage({
    message: JSON.stringify(activities, null, 2),
  });

  return JSON.parse(
    response.text.replace(/^```json\n/, "").replace(/\n```$/, "")
  );
}
```

### Benefits

- **Fraud Prevention**: Blocks fake or manipulated activities
- **Fair Rewards**: Ensures genuine efforts are properly recognized
- **Sustainability Focus**: Prioritizes eco-friendly transportation
- **Scalability**: Handles high volumes of activity verification
- **Transparency**: Verification scores are visible to users

### API Configuration

To enable AI verification, obtain a Google Gemini API key:

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
   ```

## üîê Security Features

- **OAuth 2.0**: Secure Strava authentication
- **AI Fraud Detection**: Google Gemini AI verifies activity authenticity
- **Signature Verification**: Cryptographic proof for rewards
- **Wallet Integration**: Non-custodial user control
- **Rate Limiting**: API protection against abuse
- **Input Validation**: Secure data handling

## ‚öôÔ∏è VeChain SDK Integration

### Private Key Management

The application uses the VeChain SDK to interact with smart contracts. Private keys are derived from a mnemonic phrase stored securely in environment variables.


### Thor Client Configuration

The application connects to VeChain testnet using the Thor client:

```typescript
const thor = new ThorClient(
  new SimpleHttpClient("https://testnet.vechain.org/"),
  {
    isPollingEnabled: false,
  }
);
```

### Smart Contract Initialization

Smart contracts are loaded with a signer for transaction authorization:

```typescript
const cycle2earnContract = thor.contracts.load(
  "0x90ae6877c3fd0124f10a4e41042a97a61e25b765",
  cycle2earnAbi,
  new VeChainPrivateKeySigner(
    Buffer.from(privateKey),
    new VeChainProvider(thor)
  )
);
```

### Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit mnemonics or private keys to version control
2. **Key Derivation**: Use BIP39 mnemonics with proper derivation paths
3. **Hex Format**: Ensure private keys are properly formatted (64 hex characters)
4. **Network Selection**: Use testnet for development, mainnet for production
5. **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate production keys and mnemonics

## üìä Strava API Integration

### Setup Process

1. **Create Strava Application**
   - Visit [Strava API Settings](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
   - Create a new application
   - Note your Client ID and Client Secret

2. **Configure Redirect URI**
   - Set callback domain to `localhost:3000` (development)
   - Update for production domain

3. **API Rate Limits**
   - Unauthenticated: 100 requests/15 minutes
   - Authenticated: 1000 requests/15 minutes
   - Premium users: Higher limits available

### Data Synced
- **Athlete Profile**: Name, profile picture, stats
- **Activities**: Distance, duration, elevation, type
- **Statistics**: Weekly/monthly totals, achievements

## üöÄ Deployment

### Environment Setup

1. **Production Environment Variables**
   ```env
   STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=your_production_client_id
   STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_production_client_secret
   STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback
   MNEMONIC=your_production_mnemonic
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_production_gemini_key
   ```

2. **Build the Application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Smart Contract Deployment
